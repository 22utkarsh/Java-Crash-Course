- String in java is not a datatype and also not a wrapper class.
- String is a normal class in java.
- String is a Immutable (cannot do changes in object).
- If we try to do the changes it will creates a new object , 
  Hence if there is a lot of changes in string , we should not create a string object
  we should have to create StringBuffer or StringBuillder which are the mutable.
 
- StringBuffer or StringBuilder both are same there no much difference ; where
  StringBuffer is synchronous and StringBuilder is asynchronous hence we should use 
  StringBuffer in thread classes and StringBuilder in normal class.

  
Assignment:
-  Accept the string and check is it palindrome ?

-  Accept a sentence and display the biggest  word.

- check is it email or not
- check string should have 3 characters only


Types of Object--------

1. DTO (data transfer object) : 
- this object will carry the data from one point to another point and it olds all the data,
- it does not have any logics,this is also called as POJO(plain old java obj)
- DTO contains data members which are private encapsulated , this can be accessed using read write or both
 read write permission using get() method, set() method.

2. BO (Business Object) :
- this will not have data with it , but it contains only the business logics
- it takes DTO and executes the logic on that.


3. DAO (data acess object) :
- It reads or writes the data into the database using DTO.
