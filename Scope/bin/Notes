Scope of variable:
- Scope mean where the variable is available or dead(scope ends)
- this is different from encapsulation like private , public...


Local scope :
- a variable declared in the method or a block like for, try local variable will not be initialised
  we have to initialize before we use other wise it is compile time error
             
 e.g for(int i=0; i<10; i++){try{int k; sop(k);}catch(Exception e){}}   // error as k is not initialise
 
 
 
 Instance Scope :
 - the variable inside the class and outside the method is instance scope
 - they are auto initialize by default values
 - they exist when a object is created and ends when the object goes for Garbage Colle.
 - if more instance is created then all the instance will have separate copy of the instance vriale
   if the object is not created we cannot use .
   e.g class Add{int a,b,c}
   
   
   
  
 Class Scope:
 - the variable inside the class and outside the method is with static is class scope 
 - it can be access or available before or after object creation
 - there will be only one copy of class variable.
  e.g: class Add{int a,b; static int c};
  
  
 What is a Dispose Technique?
 closing the resources before the object going to the garbage colle.
