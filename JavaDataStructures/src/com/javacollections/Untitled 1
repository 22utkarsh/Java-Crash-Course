Collections :
- the collection is where the data is stored before or after processing.
- same thing is done by using array but array is static and number of elements are defined 
  we cannot change the number.
- where collection are dynamic we will not define the elements and we can increase
  or delete the element in run
  
 
In java the collection is a Framework , frameworks means it contains all the api(application programming interface)

Collection Framework contains Interface, class and algorithm

1. Collection (it is an interface)(only value):
   1.1 List : it is ordered , can accept duplicate , can be access by index
            class: ArrayList , Vector , LinkedList
            
   1.2 Set : unordered , cannot store duplicates , cannot accept by index
   			class : HashSet(unordered), HashTree(Sorted), LinkedHashset(ordered)
   			
   1.3 Queue : FIFO ordered 
   			  class: PriorityArray or LinkedList
   
   1.4 Dequeue : double ended queue , can access both FIFO and LIFO.
   				class:  ArrayDeque or linkedList

2. 	Map (key and value)


*) Generic Template :a class created without datatype , but object is created with data type
                     i.e, the same class can be used for the multiple data type
   - Generic Template mainly used for the storage like collections , and should not use for computations
   - in java Generic template supports only wrapper classes and class not for the primitive datatypes.
   e.g int is primitive and Integer is a wrapper class
   
   
   
*) Iterator: 
 - iterator take a copy of the data and display one by one
 - iterator is a forward direction (cannot travel to previous data), back tracing is not possible
 - when iterator is executing we cannot update that collection
         
    
 Assignments:     
  1. take array and remove all the duplicate elements of the array   
    
  2. Accept the sentence and show how many times the each word is repeating
  3. Accept student details (fname ,age,marks) and display the student in alphabetical order
