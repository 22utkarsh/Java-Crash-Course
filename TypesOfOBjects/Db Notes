DBMS (there is no connectivity or relation between table) and rdbms (the table are connected each other using value that is primary key and foreign key)

Management system refers for : the software which manage the data

Data base: it is a grp of related data file or tables or relation or entity set

- a table is made up of no. of rows or tuples or record or entity (ORM object relation mapping)
- each row is made up of no. of columns or feilds
- column has got attributes and domain
- attribute: name given to column
- domain: type of character set store in attribute

Normalization: removing the redundancy and making the column as single value (mv) we will go for 
    decomposing we will split one table in to multiple and on column into many column
    
   
   
Functional Dependancy: 

Integrity ConstrainsL it is rules applied to get correct or valid data
types---
  1) Entity integrity : rows are not duplicate using primary key
  2) referential integrity : foreign key
  3) domain integrity business rules given by the client check
