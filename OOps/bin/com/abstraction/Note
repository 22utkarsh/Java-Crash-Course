1.) Lambda Expression is the simple way od implementing the Interface 
    without creating the class and the structure
    
2) Lambda Expression is only work for a Interface which has only one abstract method.
  .And cannot be implemented if it contains more than one abstract method.'
  This concept is also called as Functional Programming
  
3) To Implement the good functional programming we should do Interface Segregation,
  where we create more interfaces with single functionality.
