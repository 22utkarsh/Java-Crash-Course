  III)
  1. what is tightly coupled technique and loosely couped thechnique?
  --> int a=10;
  	  Add add = new Add(10,20);  same reference same object is tightly coupled technique
  	  
  	  Parent parRef = new ChildeObj()  // parent refrence child Object is loosely coupled
  	  *** we have to use loosely coupled technique always*** 
  	  this is called Licusive Principle
  	  
  2. WAP to Add,Subtract,Multiply,divide based on the choice, 
    (you should not use any controlled statements like if,switch case....)
