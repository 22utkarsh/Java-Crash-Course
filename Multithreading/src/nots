Thread : 
-light weight process ; A thread is small part of the process 


Why need of thread? : 
- To do concurrent programming that means multiple jobs will be running parallely.
- to process huge data part by part
- to design games 
- to response to multiple request


How the thread is created in java:
- when a class extends a THread class it become a thread
  and we require to override the run method
  
- the thread will start when the run method begin
- the thread will end when the run method end
- we should not call the run method direclty ; 
   we should call it using start method.

- when the run method calls any other method it should synchronized or thread safe.
