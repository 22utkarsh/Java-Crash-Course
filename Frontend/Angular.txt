Angular
 
- Angular is a framework which works using html css and ts.
- Angular is a framework which got lot of components , it works in the format of components.

- What is Component? : a small piece or small part of the application is called component.
  e.g : In a Home page we have navbar as a component , aside bar as a component , main display as another component
    - in application we develope small small components and integrate at one part to make it as a application
    - every component is recognise by something called as selectors. and this selector name is use in the integration or 
       while calling the component.



- Angular has 2 main things component and services.
- component has css,html,ts(logics and variables) and service has got only certain logic without html and css.

- Why we want Service ? :
    - certain logics need in a multiple component so instead of typing the logic in every component and making the duplicate
      code so we can make use of service so we can define the logic in service use same service in different component.

- How component uses the service?
    1) by creating the objet of the service class , which is a bad way of coding because in the multiple component multiple
      object has to create for the same service
    2) Dependancy Injection (DI) which creates the object and keeps in container and use that same object in every component.
       so here only 1 object is created (singlton) .



- Decorators :
	- it is a annotation or preprocessors which gives some information to the compiler to what it has to do.
	here in angular to indicate it is a decorator we use '@' symbol as same as java.

- we use 'ng' to indicate it is angular.

-Modules: it is a group of the component (like packages in java). so any module provided by the angular called 'ngModule'.
      - ngModule which works only on the databinding

- a component contains a class , html ,css. A class contains variables , methods.


- Data Binding: 
   - the variables declared inside the class can be used in html template using '{{...}}' , this is called as one way      binding.
   - if I do the changes in the html , those values will be automatically update in class variables , this is called as two      way binding.
   - one way binding will happen automatially, but to do two-way binding we need to use "ngModel"







- To install angular : > npm install @angular/cli

- to create new angular project : > ng new appname 

- to execute a project : > ng serve

- to genearte component: > ng g c compo_Name

- to generate service: > ng g s service_name

- a component is described under selectors , a service is described under provider.





-ngDirectives : which are used in html templates
   - to indicate it is a directive we should use '*'
  e.g : *ngif , *ngfor   this should in the tag which repetative.
   e.g <table> tag is not a repeatative ; <tr>is  a repeatative tags
       <ol> is not repeatative , so <li> is repeatative tag
